# PROBLEM STATEMENT ADDRESSED
In manufacturing and production industries, calculating the total production cost manually is time-consuming, error-prone, and often leads to inaccurate budgeting. Our solution addresses this by developing a smart, AI-assisted cost calculator that automates the process, ensures accuracy, and assists teams in making better financial and resource¬†decisions.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Setup instructions(How to Run it)
Make sure you have these installed:

Node.js & npm (for frontend)

Python 3.x (for backend)

pip (Python package manager)

üîπ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

üîπ Backend Setup (Flask App)

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
cd backend

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # for macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate        # for Windows

3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Flask server:
python app.py

5. Backend will start on:
http://localhost:5000

üîπ Frontend Setup (React App)

1. Open a new terminal tab/window and navigate to the frontend folder:
cd frontend

2. Install dependencies:
npm install

3. Start the development server:
npm start

4. React app will run at:
http://localhost:3000
üîÅ Ensure CORS and API Connectivity

Make sure the frontend makes requests to the correct backend URL (usually http://localhost:5000) in your React code (often inside Axios or fetch calls).
